# React Business Dashboard

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently. Your instructor(s) will give you instructions._

You have just joined DataMining Inc. (DMI), a company that creates data dashboards for businesses and organizations. DMI needs your help to finish an MVP for one of their clients: a coffee shop called Yahtzee Coffee. This coffee shop has a few datasets that need to be visualized for the owner.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Add the appropriate charts for displaying the following datasets
  - Employee salaries over a month (recommended: pie chart)
  - Daily net profit over a month (recommended: line graph)
- Each chart should have the ability to be toggled on/off using the provided sidebar

#### Starter code

The provided starter code uses the `create-react-app` template, so setup can be done by running `npm install` in the folder. Check the `package.json` file for the other scripts you can use for development and testing. Also, become familiar with the directory structure and the functionality of any existing components.

#### Deliverable

Here's an example screenshot of the finished deliverable.
